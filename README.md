# News Site
For this project, I have made a simple news site. It will consist of a homepage (showing website statistics and recent news), a page for each news article, a login/signup page (complete with authentication), and an admin panel. The goal of this site is to provide a simple solution to hosting your own news site.

### Technologies
For this news site, I will be using Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, and PostgreSQL.

### Purpose
The intended purpose of this project was to work on using Node and Express. It allowed for me to handle user authentication and communication with the database. In addition, this will give me the opportunity to work on my website design.

  #### The Good
  At time of writing, the project is nearly complete. It is currently functional and can be used with minimal errors. Users with the correct role are able to submit       articles that can be seen on the index page as well as their own separate page. Users can signup, login, and logout. In addition, those with the correct role can view   and manage forms that were submitted, articles, and other members. The website is also responsive.

  #### The Bad
  There are a few parts of the project that can be worked on. There are a few status errors that need to be in place. Also, the some of the controllers can definitely be   improved. I plan on making revisions to the news site often.

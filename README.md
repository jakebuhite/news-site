# News Site
(CURRENTLY IN THE WORKS)
For this project, I plan on making a simple news site. It will be complete with a homepage, a page for each post, a login/signup page, and an admin panel. The goal of this site is to learn and practice express.js. In addition, this will give me the opportunity to improve my CSS skills. 

### Technologies
For this news site, I will be using Node.js, Express.js. (Other technologies may be added in the future).
